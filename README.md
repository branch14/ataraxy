# Ataraxy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/ataraxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/ataraxy)

A data-driven routing and destructuring library for [Ring][]. This
library is still being developed, so some functionality may change
before we hit version 1.0.0.

## Rationale

There are several data-driven routing libraries for Ring, such as
[bidi][], [Silk][] and [gudu][]. Ataraxy differs from them because
it not only seeks to match a route, it also destructures the
incoming request.

In this sense it is similar to [Compojure][], in that the idea is to
remove extraneous information. However, while Compojure is designed to
use chains of functions, Ataraxy defines its functionality through a
declarative data structure.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [ataraxy "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]


## Overview

Ataraxy uses a data structure to tell it how to route and destructure
requests.

```clojure
(def routes '{"/foo" [:foo]})
```

We can match a request map to a result with `matches`:

```clojure
(ataraxy/matches routes {:uri "/foo"})
=> [:foo]
```

If Ataraxy cannot find a matching route, then `[:ataraxy/not-found]`
will be returned. This behavior may be extended in future to support
different types of failure.

For performance, we can also pre-compile the routing data:

```clojure
(def compiled-routes (ataraxy/compile routes))
```

The resulting object can be used in `matches` in the same way as the
raw data structure:

```clojure
(ataraxy/matches compiled-routes {:uri "/foo"})
=> [:foo]
```

Once we have our routes, it's likely we want to turn them into a Ring
handler function. Ataraxy has a function called `handler` for this
purpose:

```clojure
(def handler
  (ataraxy/handler
   routes
   {:foo
    (fn [req] {:status 200, :headers {}, :body "Foo"})
    :ataraxy/not-found
    (fn [req] {:status 404, :headers {}, :body "Not found"})}))
```

This function takes two arguments; the routes and a map of keys to
handlers. The full result will be added to the `:ataraxy/result` key
on the request map.


## Syntax

Ataraxy generates routes from a **routing table**, which is a Clojure
map, or a list of alternating keys and values.

The keys of the table are **routes**, and the data type used defines a
way of matching and destructuring a request.

The values are either **results** or nested tables. Results are always
vectors, beginning with a keyword.

Here's a semi-formal definition of the syntax:

```
table  = {<route result>+} | (<route result>+)
route  = keyword | string | symbol | set | map | [route+]
result = table | [keyword symbol*]
```

### Keyword routes

A keyword will match the request method. For example:

```clojure
{:get [:foo]})
```

This route will match any request with the GET method.

### String routes

A string will match the `:path-info` or `:uri` key on the request. For
example:

```clojure
{"/foo" [:foo]
 "/bar" [:bar]}
```

This example will match the URIs "/foo" and "/bar".

### Symbol routes

Like strings, symbols match against the `:path-info` or `:uri` key on
the request. Unlike strings, they match on a regular expression, and
bind the string matched by the regular expression to the symbol.

By default the regex used is `[^/]+`. In other words, any character
except a forward slash. The regex can be changed by adding a `:re` key
to the symbol's metadata. For example:

```clojure
{^{:re "/d.g"} w [:word w]} 
```

This will match URIs like "/dog", "/dig" and "/dug", and add the
matched word to the result.

### Set routees

A set of symbols will match URL-encoded parameters of the same name.
For example:

```clojure
{#{q} [:query q]}
```

This will match any request with "q" as a parameter. For example,
"/search?q=foo".


### Map routes

A map will destructure the request. Any destructured symbol must not
be `nil` for the route to match. For example:

```clojure
{{{:keys [user]} :session} [:user user]}
```

This route will match any request map with a `:user` key in the
session.


### Vector routes

A vector combines the behavior of multiple routing rules. For example:

```clojure
{[:get "/foo"] [:foo]}
```

This will match both the request method and the URI.

Strings and symbols will be combined in order, to allow complex paths
to be matched. For example:

```clojure
{[:get "/user/" name "/info"] [:get-user-info name]}
```

This will match URIs like "/user/alice/info" and pass the name "alice"
to the result.

### Nested tables

Nesting routing tables is an alternative way of combining routes.
Instead of a result vector, a map or list may be specified. For
example:

```clojure
{"/foo"
 {"/bar" [:foobar]
  "/baz" [:foobaz]}})
```

This will match the URIs "/foo/bar" and "/foo/baz".

You can also use nesting and vectors together:

```clojure
{["/user/" name]
 {:get [:get-user name]
  :put [:put-user name]}}
```
